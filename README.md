# Used javascript to add data into a table on a webpage
## The dataset includes UFO data with the following elements: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, comments

# Created a functional filter by which the user can filter by date, and show only the matching rows
## Handles cases where invalid dates are entered or the input field is left blank
